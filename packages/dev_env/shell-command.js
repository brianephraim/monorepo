  This file used in 2 places
    1.  This file is executed by the monorepo serving as the monorepo's dev environment.
        (Only the monorepo uses dev_env like this. When the monorepo's packages are scattered
        into individual repos, each individual repo has a dev_env dependency
        in its node_modules folder,
        but this dev_env is executed from a compiled version of the dev_env.
        This is called from the individual repo's ./node_modules/.bin/devenv,
        which points to ./node_modules/@defualt/dev_env/dist/dev_env.js.)
    2.  This file is executed during the npm prepublish, which creates the /dist folder
        mentioned in (1) above.
